       "['Last night, my girlfriend  and I got back from an evening at the beach. We went to my house for a little bit just to spend some time together (she texted her mom to let her know that she was safe). We watched a TV show here and there and then spent the next few hours just talking to each other, kissing and cuddling. Without us realizing, it got a little late and we grew tired. She asked if she could take a quick nap which I said was no problem. However, I ended up falling asleep as well and when I came to, it was 2:00 in the morning. I realized that I was way too tired to safely drive her home and we ended up spending the night together and didn’t wake up until 7:00 this morning. My parents were already asleep by this time and I didn’t want to wake them and I hoped that they’d be understanding. \\n\\nA few minutes after we were both awake, I made her breakfast and then drove her home. My mom was more understanding than her partner who said what I did was horrible and an asshole thing to do. My mom of course still wasn’t exactly pleased but she was happy to know that we didn’t have sex or anything (which I wouldn’t have done anyways because we’re not at that point yet.) Did I do the right thing last night or am I, like my mom’s partner says, an asshole?\\n\\nAdditional Information: \\n\\nMy girlfriend and I are both close to 19 (she turns 19 next week and I turn 19 in three months)\\n\\nWe have been together for a little over a month\\n\\nMy mom’s partner and I have been at each other’s throats for 8 of the 13 years that she and my mom have been together. Which is why I’m asking this on here because I know I might be a little biased when it comes to what she says. \\n\\n\\nEdit: Feel free to ask any further questions about the situation and I Will answer 100% honestly.\\n']"
